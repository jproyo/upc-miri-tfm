\chapter{Appendix}
\section{Source Code}
All the source code of this research project can be found in \url{https://github.com/jproyo/upc-miri-tfm}, and it is publicly available for download.
In that source code there are three folders:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{connected-comp}: This contains the \acrshort{hs} source code done for the \autoref{prole} contribution related to \acrfull{wcc} using \acrshort{dp}.
  \item \textbf{bt-graph-dp}: This contains the \acrshort{hs} source code done for the specific problem of this work which is incremental enumeration of \acrlong{bt} in \acrlong{bg}.
  \item \textbf{doc}: Contains this document in LaTex format as well as the paper written for the proof of concept~\cite{prole21}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Running Experiments}\label{apx:running:experiments}
All the scripts and data for running the experiments are under \mintinline{shell}{bt-graph-dp/experiments} folder.
It is important to mention that we are not including in the source code distribution the networks themselves because you can search them on Konect~\cite{konect} by the reference in this work.
We are going to describe how to run the different experiments exposed on \autoref{experiments}. 

\paragraph{E1} In this case we have different experiments setups and we are going to describe how to run one case only.
For example for running the experiment setup $E-H$ on \acrshort{dbpedia} graph, assuming that you download the graph and call the file as 
\mintinline{shell}{input.txt} and it is inside of folder \mintinline{shell}{bt-graph-dp/experiments/diepfy/dbpedia}.
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
>>> cd bt-graph-dp
>>> stack build
>>> stack exec bt-graph-dp -- +RTS -A1G -H1G -N6 -c -RTS -f ./experiments/diepfy/dbpedia/input.txt -c ./experiments/diepfy/dbpedia/c-edge-high.txt -e dbpedia
\end{minted}


\paragraph{E2} In the case of benchmark analysis it is simple the following command
\begin{minted}{bash}
  >>> cd bt-graph-dp
  >>> stack build
  >>> stack exec benchmark
  \end{minted}

\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 1 fil}
This is going to left the results in HTML file format under \mintinline{bash}{benchmark}.


\paragraph{E3} In the case of Memory and Thead Measurement you need to enable profiling flags.

For Memory
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
>>> cd bt-graph-dp
>>> stack build --profile
>>> stack exec bt-graph-dp -- +RTS -A10G -H10G -c -N12 -hy -l-agu -RTS -f ./experiments/diepfy/moreno_crime/input.txt -c ./experiments/diepfy/moreno_crime/c-edge-high.txt -e moreno_crime
\end{minted}

For ThreadScope
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
>>> cd bt-graph-dp
>>> stack build --profile
>>> stack exec bt-graph-dp -- +RTS -A10G -H10G -c -N12 -l -s -RTS -f ./experiments/diepfy/moreno_crime/input.txt -c ./experiments/diepfy/moreno_crime/c-edge-high.txt -e moreno_crime
\end{minted}
