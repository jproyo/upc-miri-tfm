\chapter{Dynamic Pipeline Framework in Haskell}\label{dp-hs}
\section{Introduction}
One of the fundamental piece of the present work as we have described in ~\autoref{intro} and ~\autoref{prelim},
is the design and implementation of \acrshort{dp} in a Framework written in \acrshort{hs} which allow \acrshort{hs} users
to implement any suitable algorithm in \acrshort{dp}, providing the correct abstractions that helps on that matter.

During the process of conducting this research, we implemented \acrfull{dpl}~\cite{dynamic-pipeline}: 
a \acrfull{dpf} written in \acrshort{hs} and published into Hackage (The public Haskell Package Repository of Libraries).
In this chapter we are going to describe the design and implementation details of \acrshort{dpl}.
