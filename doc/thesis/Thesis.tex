\acknowledgements{
  I would like to express my gratitude first to the main supervisor of this work, Edelmira Pasarella, who has taken the chance to accept me as her student without knowing me beforehand and supporting me during the whole process. 
  I would like to thank as well to the other supervisors: Cristina Zoltan who helped me, among other things, with the formalization of the most challenging part, the algorithm, and Maria-Esther Vidal for teaching and guiding me in the empirical evaluation part.
  I wish to thank to my partner, Erica, who has supported me for the last two years and a half during this journey. 
  I would like to make a special thanks to my 6-years old daughter, Ludmila, who despite her young age, she has perfectly understood when his father needed to spend more time studying than playing with her. I hope this has also played an important lesson in your life Ludmila: sometimes you need to work hard to achieve something you want.
  Finally, grateful to myself because I could manage to deal with all the commitments: an eight-hour daily work, the classes, my parenthood, and the rest of my personal life.

\abstract{
In this work, we tackle the problem of providing an algorithm for incrementally enumerating bitriangles in large bipartite Networks. A bipartite network is a graph with two disjoint vertex sets where edges only connect vertices from different sets. In bipartite graphs,  the bitriangle is considered the smallest unit of cohesion. 
For this kind of networks, counting bitriangles is extremely useful for conducting social analysis and  computing metrics such as clustering coefficient. This is why lately  there has been efforts in developing efficient algorithms for counting bitriangles. 
However,  there are cases in which knowing structural information of bitriangles in a bipartite network is required; e.g. in disorder/disease gene association networks where it is important to know the gene causing the disease. In general, specific information about bitriangles is useful for any problem requiring linking data in bipartite networks. Depending on the size of the graph, enumerating bitriangles could be a high-resource consuming task and an "all-or-nothing" computation model might not deliver any result at all. 
To be concrete, in this work we propose, implement and empirically evaluate an algorithm for enumerating bitriangles incrementally according to some specific criteria. Additionally, we provide a correctness proof of the algorithm. Our proposal is based on the Dynamic Pipeline computational model  that nicely supports the \emph{pay-as-you-go}  approach. In this way  users are able to  receive results and conduct analysis as long as they have computational resources at their disposal. This solution could be extremely useful and powerful for real networks and scenarios like expressed before. Apart from this main contribution, we develop a Dynamic Pipeline Framework in (parallel) Haskell. In fact, the implementation of our algorithm relies upon this framework. Finally, we conduct, analyze and report experiments against large bipartite networks  having up to $350$ millions of bitriangles. Obtained results satisfy our expectations. To assess the incremental delivery of results we measure the \textit{Diefficiency metrics}, i.e. the continuous efficiency of the implementation of the algorithm for generating incremental results.
