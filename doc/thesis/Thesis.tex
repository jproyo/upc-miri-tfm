\acknowledgements{
  I would like to express my gratitude first to the main supervisor of this work, Edelmira Pasarella, who has taken the chance to accept me as her student without knowing me beforehand and supporting me during the whole process. 
  I would like to thank as well to the other supervisors: Cristina Zoltan who helped me, among other things, with the formalization of the most challenging part, the algorithm, and Maria-Esther Vidal for teaching and guiding me in the empirical evaluation part.
  I wish to thank to my partner, Erica, who has supported me for the last two years and a half during this journey. 
  I would like to make a special thanks to my 6-years old daughter, Ludmila, who despite her young age, she has perfectly understood when his father needed to spend more time studying than playing with her. I hope this has also played an important lesson in your life Ludmila: sometimes you need to work hard to achieve something you want.
  Finally, grateful to myself because I could manage to deal with all the commitments: an eight-hour daily work, the classes, my parenthood, and the rest of my personal life.

\abstract{
A bipartite network is a graph with two disjoint vertex sets where its edges only connect vertices from different sets. 
For instance, two different object sets can be modeled with a bipartite graph, establishing the relationships between them (e.g., a network of drugs and side effects of those drugs, a network of TV Shows and its subscriptors, diseases gene association network and many more). 
In Unipartite graph, one of the metrics that reflects strong relationships on elements is triangles.
Although Bipartite Graphs does not have such element of measure, there exists a similar smallest unit of cohesion which is the Bitriangle. 
Lately, there has been some related work related counting bitriangles in bipartite networks.
Counting is extremely useful for calculating metrics such as clustering coefficient, social analysis, or bitriangles based-communities, but there are some use cases in which knowing structural information of those Bitriangles is required; e.g. in disorder/disease gene association networks where it is important to know the gene causing the disease.
Moreover, depending on the size of the graph enumerating bitriangles could be a high-resource consuming task and an "all-or-nothing" computation model might not deliver any result at all. In the opposite, a \emph{pay-as-you-go} computational model approach can be provided giving the fact the user is able to conduct analysis as long as it receives some results without waiting the for rest of them.
In that sense, an Algorithm that Enumerates Bitriangles incrementally matching a specific criteria is extremely useful and powerful for real networks and scenarios like expressed before. 
%Streaming processing has given rise to new computation paradigms processing data effectively.
%The most important features of these paradigms are the exploitation of parallelism, the capacity to adapt execution schedulers, 
%reconfigure computational structures, adjust the use of resources according to the characteristics of the input stream and produce incremental results. 
%The Dynamic Pipeline Paradigm (DPP) is a naturally functional approach to deal with stream processing. 
%This fact encourages us to use Haskell, a purely functional programming language, for DPP.  
In this work, we tackle the problem of providing an Algorithm for Incrementally Enumerating Bitriangles in large Bipartite Networks, following the next steps:
  \begin{inparaenum}[\bf i\upshape)]
      \item We validate the suitability of (parallel) Haskell to implement a Dynamic Pipeline Framework (DPF).
      \item Then, we provide the abstraction and implementation details of a general purpose Dynamic Pipeline Framework written in Haskell.
      \item We define, implement and provide a correctness analysis of an Algorithm for Incrementally Enumerating Bitriangles in large Bipartite Networks. 
      \item Finally, we empirically evaluate the implementation of the algorithm against large bipartite networks through a series of experiments and discuss the conclusions that we reach analyzing the empirical data.
